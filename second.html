                            There is no static definition on how to best be an ally to the undocumented/DACAmented community. However, we know it involves an amalgam of being present, listening, advocating and understanding. We encourage everyone continuously educate themselves on what they can do to support their undocumented/DACAmented community, especially here at Swarthmore.

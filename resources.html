            Limitations
          </p>
          <p class = "is-size-6">
              Because of the legal limitations on paid work, undocumented students are not able to access paid positions that give students additional academic experiences, including supporting faculty research, serving as peer tutors and mentors, and more. Those experiences are employment opportunities and must be limited to students with work authorization, as required by law.<br/>
              <br />
          <p class = "is-size-5">
            Current Policy at Swarthmore
          </p>
          <p class = "is-size-6">
            In effect October 2020: All students, regardless of immigration status, are eligible to participate in experiential learning opportunities funded through the College as long as the opportunity is primarily for the benefit of the student’s education, professional growth or training, and not for the benefit of the College.

            In order to assess whether a particular opportunity fits into this criteria, ask the following questions: Is the primary goal of the opportunity to support student growth and development? Is the primary role of the faculty/ staff member an advisor, mentor, or trainer?

          <h2 class = "title is-size-5 has-text-dark">Swarthmore Extern Program*</h2>
            <p class = "is-size-6">
              Because this is a strictly unpaid opportunity, it is recommended that undocumented students apply. This externship program matches students with Swarthmore alumni and provides a 1-week opportunity during Winter Break to shadow the alumnus at their job. It is recommended that low-income students apply for funding to compensate for food and transportation costs. Applications for funding, important deadlines, and ways to apply can be found here. <br/>
              <br />

            <h2 class = "title is-size-5 has-text-dark">Richard Ruben Mentoring Program*</h2>
              <p class = "is-size-6">
                The program, Rubin says, aims to provide guidance to students from backgrounds that sometimes lack important links and advice counseling due to economic or social circumstances. Students in the program are provided with mentors from College faculty or staff and, from their sophomore year on, may benefit from further mentoring and participation in paid internships hosted by alumni in established careers. Separate from Career Services, the program has its own database of internships and mentors. Program participants are either nominated by faculty or staff members with whom they already have mentoring relationships, or they may self-nominate and request campus mentors from among the faculty and staff. <br/>

                <p class = "is-size-6">
                  The Lang Opportunity Scholarship (LOS) Program each year selects members of Swarthmore’s sophomore class as Lang Scholars. Selection criteria include distinguished academic and co-curricular achievement, leadership qualities, and demonstrated commitment to civic and social responsibility. This program offers a diverse range of benefits including a $10,000 grant, a designated adviser, and networking opportunities to support the development of a project that creates a needed social resource in the U.S. or abroad. The program was conceived and endowed by Eugene M. Lang ’38.<br/>

                <p class = "is-size-6">
                  The purpose of the Fund is to supports groups of Swarthmore students who propose and implement social and civic action projects whose scope and sustainability will advance solutions for the issues in question and also promote recognition of students' motivation and capability to address such major issues effectively. Any team of two or more currently enrolled students may apply for grants of up to $25,000 to fund projects that are visionary in scope and groundbreaking in practice. <br/>

                  The intention of this program is to empower scholars with their partners to engage in systems change activities designed to close the gap(s) between social challenges and solutions. Key features of the Lang Social Impact Fellowship program include: mentoring, training, and funding.   <br/>

                The Chester Community Fellowship (CCF)—a signature Lang Center program funded through the Swarthmore Foundation— enhances the capacity of Chester-based community organizations while providing opportunities for student learning. Students hold internships four days a week; on the fifth day, Fellows work together on a project-in-common relevant to the City of Chester. The summer experience focuses on developing each Chester Fellow as a scholar, civic leader, and public servant. <br/>

              <p class = "is-size-6">
                While undocumented and DACAmented students are prohibited from traveling outside the United States, undocumented and DACAmented students are permitted to travel inside the United States. Historically, the college has offered undocumented/DACAmented students to replicate experiences similiar to a study abroad program by traveling to Hawaii or Puerto Rico for a semester and attending schools in those locations. Please consult Jen Marks Gold if this is an opportunity you would like to pursue. <br/>

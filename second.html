                      <h2 class = "subtitle">Swatties for Immigrant Rights (SIR) comprises of the undocumented and DACAmented student community and their allies that pushes to reform Swarthmore as an equitable institution for every student, regardless of immigration status. SIR serves multiple functions for providing support for Swarthmore’s undocumented and DACAmented students. First, it provides a space for the students to meet on a weekly basis and hang out, discuss any questions, concerns, ideas regarding being a undocumented/DACAmented student and generates an overall tight support system for each other. Recently, SIR has also branched out into pursuing advocacy work fighting the systemic inequities that undocumented/DACAmented students face in higher academia, and as a result, opened a new branch where non-undocumented/DACAmented student allies can join to be apart of this movement. </h2>

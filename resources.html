                          Because of the legal limitations on paid work, undocumented students are not able to access paid positions that give students additional academic experiences, including supporting faculty research, serving as peer tutors and mentors, and more. Those experiences are employment opportunities and must be limited to students with work authorization, as required by law.</p>

                        In effect October 2020: All students, regardless of immigration status, are eligible to participate in experiential learning opportunities funded through the College as long as the opportunity is primarily for the benefit of the studentâ€™s education, professional growth or training, and not for the benefit of the College.

                        In order to assess whether a particular opportunity fits into this criteria, ask the following questions: Is the primary goal of the opportunity to support student growth and development? Is the primary role of the faculty/ staff member an advisor, mentor, or trainer?

                          Because this is a strictly unpaid opportunity, it is recommended that undocumented students apply. This externship program matches students with Swarthmore alumni and provides a 1-week opportunity during Winter Break to shadow the alumnus at their job. It is recommended that low-income students apply for funding to compensate for food and transportation costs. Applications for funding, important deadlines, and ways to apply can be found here.

                          <p class = "is-size-6">
                            The program, Rubin says, aims to provide guidance to students from backgrounds that sometimes lack important links and advice counseling due to economic or social circumstances. Students in the program are provided with mentors from College faculty or staff and, from their sophomore year on, may benefit from further mentoring and participation in paid internships hosted by alumni in established careers. Separate from Career Services, the program has its own database of internships and mentors. Program participants are either nominated by faculty or staff members with whom they already have mentoring relationships, or they may self-nominate and request campus mentors from among the faculty and staff.

                              Students who participate in the Summer Research and Opportunities program are awarded a stipend of $4,800 in order to allow them to devote a substantial period of time and effort to the pursuit of a creative scholarly project, internship, work or research leading to thesis, honors (a limited number of summer stipends are available for students in the Honors Program whose summer research or other summer work will contribute directly to one of their Honors preparations), or major project preparation, or immersion in the creative arts during the summer months.  The work is intended to substantially expand the research engagement or professional exposure of students.</p>
